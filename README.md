### Project Description
---
Our project is focussed on the development of an autonomous two-wheeled robot car using the Raspberry Pi Pico W as the main microcontroller. The car is able to navigate a predefined map efficiently through the use of advanced navigation algorithms. It is also capable of obstacle detection and avoidance and the decoding of barcodes encoded in the Barcode-39 standard. A PID controller has been implemented into the car to ensure smooth executions during its movement, and the fusion of the different sensors enhances the robot car's performance and robustness through improved decision-making and accuracy.

### Program Design
---
In this section, we will go over the block diagram and modular design of the car. Our project comprises of 8 components, each catered for a particular sensor/aspect of the car:
- Main (program entrypoint for car to start executions)
- Navigation and Mapping
- Wifi
- Motor
- Ultrasonic (for obstacle detection)
- IRLine (for barcode decoding)
- Encoder (for car movement)
- Magnetometer (for car direction tracking)

**Block Diagram** <br>
The block diagram for the robot car is illustrated below. The diagram provides a high-level overview of how the car will be initialised and start up the various components. More details on each part will be provided in the individual flowchart diagrams.

**Data Diagram** <br>
To illustrate how sensor data and information will be exchanged and its movement throughout the execution process of the robot car, a data diagram is provided below.
![Data Diagram](docs/diagrams/data_diagram.png)

**Flowchart Diagram** <br>
As previously illustrated, the car comprises of many components which each need to be initialised and set up on its own (e.g interrupts, callback functions etc). The individual flowcharts for each component are illustrated below.

Firstly, the main function will be the program entrypoint of the robot car. Its inner workings are illustrated below:

The other components' flowcharts are illustrated below, in no particular execution order:

### Getting Started
---
1. Ensure that all the necessary hardware components are connected to the correct pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, and configured properly. Your final car should look something like this:
    ![Robot Car](docs/final_car.png)
2. Compile and build `main.c`, and its required dependencies (all handled in its `CMakeLists.txt`). Make sure to configure the Wifi SSID and password to connect to your desired network.
3. Flash your Raspberry Pi Pico W with the generated `.uf2` file!
4. Place the car on a maze map! You can generate a map from [here](https://www.mazegenerator.net/). Your map should look something like this:
    ![Map](docs/maze_map.png)
5. On a browser, navigate to the car's IP address, then click start!
6. Let the car run! üèéÔ∏è
