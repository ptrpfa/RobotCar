/* 
    Key Parameters:
    IR_SENSOR_PERIODIC_INTERVAL:    Tweak to modify how fast/slow (interval) for IR sensor to be activated to take readings

    MIN_BLACK_VOLTAGE:              Tweak to set the minimum voltage of a black bar (setting too low would result in more false positives, 
                                    setting too high would result in lesser detections)

    MIN_VOLTAGE_DIFF:               Tweak to modify the minimum percentage difference between the last voltage and current voltage reading
                                    for a change in state/color to be detected
